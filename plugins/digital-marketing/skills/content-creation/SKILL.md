3. **Desire**: Solution and emotional connection
4. **Action**: Clear call-to-action

Example:

STOP scrolling if you're tired of zero engagement.
Most small businesses post daily but get nothing back.

## Bilingual Content Guidelines

### English-First Approach
Write in English, then adapt to Spanish (not literal translation):
- Adjust idioms and cultural references
- Maintain tone and intent
- Localize examples if needed

### Spanish Localization Tips
- Use neutral Spanish for Latin America (avoid Spain-specific terms)
- "Tú" is generally preferred over "usted" for casual brands
- Adapt hashtags (some work in both, some need translation)

### Bilingual Post Format
Option 1: Separate posts for each language
Option 2: Combined post with language break
```
[English content]
---
[Spanish content]
```
