# Optimization Guide

This skill should be used when users want to improve campaign performance, troubleshoot low engagement, run A/B tests, or iterate on their marketing strategy. Trigger phrases include: "improve campaign", "not working", "low engagement", "optimize", "A/B test", "why isn't this working", "how to get better results".

## Diagnosing Performance Issues

### Low Reach Troubleshooting

**Symptoms**: Posts seen by fewer people than usual

**Common Causes & Fixes**:

1. **Algorithm changes**
   - Check if industry-wide
   - Adapt content format to platform preferences
   - Increase engagement triggers (questions, polls)

2. **Inconsistent posting**
   - Establish regular posting schedule
   - Don't go more than 2-3 days without posting
   - Use scheduling to maintain consistency

3. **Wrong posting times**
   - Check when your audience is online (platform insights)
   - Test different times over 2 weeks
   - Post when your specific audience is active

4. **Content format mismatch**
   - Platforms favor certain formats (e.g., Reels on IG)
   - Adapt to trending formats
   - Mix content types to see what works

### Low Engagement Troubleshooting

**Symptoms**: People see content but don't interact

**Common Causes & Fixes**:

1. **Weak hooks**
   - First line must stop the scroll
   - Use numbers, questions, or bold statements
   - Test different hook styles

2. **No clear CTA**
   - Every post needs an action request
   - Make it easy and specific
   - Use engagement CTAs ("comment", "save", "share")

3. **Wrong content for audience**
   - Review what has worked before
   - Ask audience what they want
   - Survey followers directly

4. **Generic content**
   - Add personality and unique perspective
   - Share real stories and experiences
   - Be specific, not generic

### Low Conversion Troubleshooting

**Symptoms**: Engagement but no clicks/sales

**Common Causes & Fixes**:

1. **Weak offer**
   - Clarify the value proposition
   - Add urgency or scarcity
   - Test different offers

2. **Friction in funnel**
   - Check link works correctly
   - Simplify the conversion path
   - Reduce form fields

3. **Trust issues**
   - Add social proof (testimonials)
   - Show results/case studies
   - Build relationship before selling

4. **Audience mismatch**
   - Verify you're reaching decision-makers
   - Check if audience can afford offer
   - Refine targeting

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test

**High Impact (Test First)**:
- Headlines/hooks
- Call-to-action
- Offer/value proposition
- Visual (image vs video)

**Medium Impact**:
- Caption length
- Posting time
- Hashtag strategy
- Content format (carousel vs single)

**Lower Impact**:
- Color schemes
- Font choices
- Minor wording changes

### How to Run Tests

**Basic A/B Test Process**:
1. **Choose one variable** to test
2. **Create two versions** (A = control, B = variation)
3. **Run simultaneously** or in equal conditions
4. **Wait for significant data** (100+ interactions minimum)
5. **Analyze results** and implement winner
6. **Document learnings**

**Test Duration**:
- Short tests: 3-7 days (high-traffic accounts)
- Standard tests: 1-2 weeks (medium accounts)
- Long tests: 2-4 weeks (small accounts or low frequency)

### Recording Test Results

```
TEST: [What you tested]
DATE: [Start] - [End]

VERSION A (Control):
- Description: [details]
- Reach: [number]
- Engagement: [number]
- Rate: [%]

VERSION B (Variation):
- Description: [details]
- Reach: [number]
- Engagement: [number]
- Rate: [%]

WINNER: [A or B]
DIFFERENCE: [+/- %]
CONFIDENCE: [High/Medium/Low based on sample size]

INSIGHT: [What you learned]
NEXT TEST: [What to test next]
```

## Iteration Strategies

### The 3-Week Optimization Cycle

**Week 1: Analyze**
- Review last period's performance
- Identify top and bottom performers
- Form hypothesis about what works

**Week 2: Test**
- Create new content based on hypothesis
- A/B test key variables
- Document everything

**Week 3: Implement**
- Apply learnings to all content
- Double down on what works
- Retire what doesn't

### Content Iteration Levels

**Level 1: Quick Tweaks**
- Change hook/headline
- Adjust CTA
- Modify posting time
- Effort: Minutes

**Level 2: Format Changes**
- Switch image to video
- Change single to carousel
- Add/remove elements
- Effort: Hours

**Level 3: Strategy Shifts**
- New content pillars
- Different audience targeting
- Platform focus change
- Effort: Days/Weeks

## When to Pivot vs Persist

### Signs to Keep Going (Persist)
- Gradual improvement trend
- Engagement quality is good (meaningful comments)
- You haven't given strategy enough time (< 1 month)
- Changes are showing some positive signal

### Signs to Change Direction (Pivot)
- Consistent decline over 4+ weeks
- Zero engagement despite consistent posting
- Audience feedback is negative
- Clear better-performing alternative exists

### Pivot Decision Framework

Ask these questions:
1. Have I tested at least 3 variations?
2. Did I give each test adequate time?
3. Is the problem the content or the audience?
4. What would I try if starting fresh?

If you answered "yes" to 1&2, and have clear answers to 3&4, consider pivoting.
