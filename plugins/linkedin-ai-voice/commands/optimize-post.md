Analyze and optimize a LinkedIn post draft for maximum engagement.

**Draft or description:** $ARGUMENTS

## Optimization Process

1. **Analyze current draft**
   - Evaluate hook strength (first 5 words earn the next 5?)
   - Check post structure and readability
   - Assess brand voice alignment (strategic advisor + pragmatic executive)
   - Measure length (target: 150-300 words)

2. **Hook optimization**
   - Score current hook 1-10
   - Identify issues (generic opening, no specificity, weak curiosity gap)
   - Generate 3 stronger hook alternatives using patterns from linkedin-ai-strategy skill:
     - Number + Outcome
     - Contrarian statement
     - Curiosity gap
     - Vulnerable opening
     - Direct question

3. **Structure optimization**
   - Break long paragraphs into single-line statements
   - Add white space for mobile readability
   - Ensure logical flow (hook → context → insight → CTA)
   - Check for scannable format

4. **Content optimization**
   - Sharpen the core insight
   - Add specificity (numbers, timeframes, concrete examples)
   - Remove filler words and generic statements
   - Strengthen the CTA for engagement

5. **Voice calibration**
   - Balance strategic advisor (transformation guidance) with pragmatic executive (real-world grounding)
   - Remove overly promotional or salesy language
   - Ensure cross-industry applicability

6. **Present optimized version**
   - Show original vs. optimized side by side
   - Highlight specific improvements made
   - Provide the optimized post ready to copy
   - Suggest best posting time
