Create a content calendar for the week with 1-2 high-quality LinkedIn posts.

**Optional focus:** $ARGUMENTS

## Calendar Creation Process

1. **Check content archive**
   - Read `.claude/linkedin-ai-voice.local.md` if it exists
   - Review what topics have been covered recently
   - Identify gaps in topic coverage
   - Note any engagement learnings

2. **Research current landscape** (if WebSearch available)
   - Check for major AI news this week
   - Identify trending AI topics on social media
   - Look for timely hooks or news angles

3. **Plan the week**
   For a 1-2 posts/week strategy:

   **Primary Post (required)**
   - Day: Tuesday or Wednesday (highest engagement)
   - Time: 8-10 AM in your timezone
   - Format: Select based on topic (story, list, hot take)
   - Goal: Maximum engagement and reach

   **Secondary Post (optional)**
   - Day: Thursday or Friday
   - Time: 8-10 AM
   - Format: Different from primary (variety)
   - Goal: Consistency and presence

4. **Generate calendar**

   Present as:
   ```
   ## Week of [Date]

   ### Post 1: [Day]
   - **Topic**: [specific topic]
   - **Format**: [story/list/hot take/news]
   - **Hook idea**: [draft hook]
   - **Key insight**: [main takeaway]
   - **CTA style**: [question/poll/agreement]

   ### Post 2: [Day] (Optional)
   - **Topic**: [specific topic]
   - **Format**: [different from Post 1]
   - **Hook idea**: [draft hook]
   - **Key insight**: [main takeaway]
   - **CTA style**: [question/poll/agreement]
   ```

5. **Balance considerations**
   - Rotate through topic areas (AI Adoption, Readiness, Org Structure, Scale, Ethics, News)
   - Vary formats week to week
   - Mix evergreen content with timely reactions
   - Maintain consistent voice

6. **Save to archive**
   - Append calendar to `.claude/linkedin-ai-voice.local.md` under "Content Calendar" section

## Quick Calendar Templates

**News-heavy week**: Lead with news commentary, follow with evergreen insight
**Quiet week**: Story-driven primary, framework secondary
