# LinkedIn AI Strategy

Guidance for creating high-engagement LinkedIn content focused on enterprise AI topics. Designed for building thought leadership as a strategic advisor and pragmatic executive voice.

## Content Philosophy

### Brand Voice: Strategic Advisor + Pragmatic Executive

Blend two complementary voices:

**Strategic Advisor**: Help leaders navigate AI transformation decisions with clarity
- Frame AI as a business transformation lever, not just technology
- Connect AI capabilities to strategic outcomes
- Anticipate questions executives ask before investing

**Pragmatic Executive**: Battle-tested insights from real implementations
- Share lessons from actual AI deployments (successes and failures)
- Cut through hype with grounded perspective
- Focus on what actually works vs. what sounds good in demos

### Core Topic Areas

1. **AI Adoption in Enterprise** - Rollout strategies, change management, stakeholder buy-in
2. **AI Readiness for Organizations** - Assessment frameworks, capability gaps, prerequisites
3. **Organization Structure for AI** - Team composition, reporting lines, CoE vs. embedded models
4. **AI at Scale** - Moving from pilots to production, governance, MLOps maturity
5. **AI Strategy/Ethics** - Responsible AI, bias mitigation, transparency, regulatory considerations
6. **AI Industry News** - Major announcements, funding, product launches, research breakthroughs

## Post Formats

### 1. Story-Driven Posts

Open with a specific moment or scenario. Build tension. Deliver insight.

**Structure:**
- Hook: Specific moment ("Last Tuesday, our AI project almost got killed...")
- Context: Set the scene (2-3 lines)
- Tension: What went wrong or what was at stake
- Resolution: What happened
- Lesson: The transferable insight
- CTA: Invite engagement

### 2. List/Framework Posts

Numbered insights that provide actionable value.

**Structure:**
- Hook: Promise clear value ("5 signs your AI initiative is about to stall")
- Setup: Brief context (1-2 lines)
- Items: 3-7 numbered points with brief explanations
- Synthesis: Tie it together
- CTA: Ask which resonates most

### 3. Hot Take/Opinion Posts

Strong point of view on industry trends.

**Structure:**
- Hook: Contrarian statement ("Unpopular opinion: Most AI strategies fail before the first model is built")
- Support: 2-3 reasons why
- Nuance: Acknowledge counterarguments
- Stakes: Why this matters
- CTA: Ask for agreement/disagreement

### 4. News Commentary Posts

React to breaking AI news with expert perspective.

**Structure:**
- Hook: Reference the news ("OpenAI just announced X. Here's what it means for enterprise...")
- Context: Brief summary for those who missed it
- Analysis: Your unique take (what others miss)
- Implications: Who this affects and how
- CTA: Ask what others think

## Hook Writing

The first line determines whether people read. It must stop the scroll.

### High-Performing Hook Patterns

1. **Specific Number + Outcome**: "We reduced AI project costs by 47% with one change"
2. **Contrarian Statement**: "Stop building AI chatbots. Here's why."
3. **Curiosity Gap**: "The AI feature that's killing enterprise adoption (and no one talks about it)"
4. **Vulnerable Opening**: "I made a $2M mistake with our AI strategy"
5. **Direct Question**: "Why do 87% of AI pilots never make it to production?"
6. **News + Opinion**: "[Company] just did X. This changes everything for..."
7. **Pattern Interrupt**: "Forget ROI. The real metric for AI success is..."
8. **Time-Based Urgency**: "In 18 months, companies without X will be..."

### Hook Rules

- First 5 words must earn the next 5
- Avoid generic openings ("In today's world...", "AI is transforming...")
- Be specific (numbers, names, timeframes)
- Create information asymmetry (reader must continue to close the gap)

## Engagement Optimization

### Ideal Post Structure

- **Length**: 150-300 words (sweet spot for LinkedIn algorithm)
- **Line breaks**: Every 1-2 sentences for mobile readability
- **White space**: Use single-line paragraphs
- **Formatting**: Sparingly use bold for key phrases (not available in all views)

### Call-to-Action Patterns

End posts with engagement drivers:
- "Which of these resonates most with you?"
- "What would you add to this list?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "Have you seen this pattern in your organization?"
- "Drop a [emoji] if this hits home"

### Posting Strategy (1-2 posts/week)

**Quality over quantity approach:**
- Focus on one deeply thoughtful post per week
- Optional second post for timely news/reactions
- Engage heavily in comments on posting day (first 2 hours critical)
- Respond to every comment to boost algorithmic reach
