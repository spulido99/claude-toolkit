## The Post

---

Last Tuesday, our AI project almost got killed in an executive review.

Not because the model wasn't working.
Not because we were over budget.
Not because of technical issues.

We couldn't explain the business impact in terms the CFO cared about.

"Show me the ROI" she said.

We had accuracy metrics. Latency numbers. User adoption rates.

But we didn't have:
- Revenue attributed to AI decisions
- Cost savings translated to headcount equivalents
- Time-to-value in business terms

The project survived (barely) because one VP spoke up with anecdotal evidence.

Here's what we changed:

1. Created a "business impact dashboard" alongside our ML metrics
2. Started tracking decisions influenced, not just predictions made
3. Translated every technical win into finance-speak

Three months later, same CFO became our biggest advocate.

The lesson: Your AI project doesn't fail in the model. It fails in the meeting room.

How do you translate AI success for non-technical stakeholders?

## Post Analysis

### Structure Breakdown

| Element | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook | "Last Tuesday, our AI project almost got killed..." | Creates urgency, specific timing |
| Context | "Not because..." (3 negatives) | Builds curiosity by ruling out obvious causes |
| Tension | CFO's "Show me the ROI" | Relatable villain, clear conflict |
| Gap | What we had vs. didn't have | Concrete problem statement |
| Resolution | The 3 changes we made | Actionable takeaways |
| Lesson | "Fails in the meeting room" | Memorable, quotable insight |
| CTA | Question to audience | Invites engagement |

### Why It Works

1. **Specific timing**: "Last Tuesday" feels real and recent
2. **Pattern interrupt**: Readers expect technical failure, get organizational failure
3. **Rule of three**: Three "not because" lines, three missing items, three changes
4. **Vulnerability**: Admits near-failure without being self-deprecating
5. **Actionable**: Readers can implement the three changes
6. **Universal truth**: Most AI practitioners have faced similar situations

### Metrics This Post Would Target

- **Comments**: High (relatable pain point invites sharing experiences)
- **Saves**: Medium-high (actionable framework worth saving)
- **Shares**: Medium (insights worth passing to colleagues)

### Variations

**Shorter version** (for testing):
> Our AI project almost died. Not because of the model. Because we couldn't explain it to the CFO. The fix: Stop reporting accuracy. Start reporting dollars. What's your secret for translating AI wins?

**Different hook**:
> The CFO looked at our AI dashboard and said: "I don't understand any of this."

> We spent 6 months building an AI model. Then 6 minutes losing executive support.
