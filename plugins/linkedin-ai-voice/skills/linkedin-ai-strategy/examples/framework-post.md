## The Post

---

5 signs your AI initiative is about to stall:

1. **The pilot keeps expanding**
You're adding "just one more use case" instead of shipping.

2. **Everyone's excited, no one's accountable**
Lots of stakeholders. Zero owners.

3. **The data team is a bottleneck**
Every request goes through them. They're 3 months backlogged.

4. **Success metrics keep changing**
Started with ROI. Now it's "learning and experimentation."

5. **The vendor is driving the roadmap**
They're selling capabilities. You should be solving problems.

I've seen dozens of AI initiatives stall for these exact reasons.

The fix isn't technical. It's organizational:
- Assign a single accountable owner
- Set a ship date (and stick to it)
- Define success metrics before you start

Which of these resonates most with your experience?

## Post Analysis

### Structure Breakdown

| Element | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook | "5 signs your AI initiative is about to stall" | Clear promise, specific number |
| Setup | None (straight to list) | Efficient, respects reader time |
| List items | 5 signs with explanations | Core value, scannable format |
| Credibility | "I've seen dozens..." | Establishes authority |
| Synthesis | "The fix isn't technical" | Ties items together with insight |
| Action | 3 bullet fixes | Gives reader next steps |
| CTA | "Which resonates most?" | Easy engagement trigger |

### Why It Works

1. **Odd number**: 5 feels more authentic than 4 or 6
2. **Negative framing**: "Signs of failure" more compelling than "tips for success"
3. **Diagnosis before prescription**: Helps readers identify the problem first
4. **Bold formatting**: Makes scanning easy (critical for mobile)
5. **Each item is standalone**: Reader gets value even if they only read 2-3
6. **Synthesis adds insight**: Elevates from list to wisdom

### Metrics This Post Would Target

- **Saves**: Very high (people save lists for reference)
- **Shares**: High (easy to tag colleagues)
- **Comments**: Medium-high (multiple entry points for agreement)

### Variations

**Positive framing**:
> 5 signs your AI initiative is on track to succeed:

**More specific**:
> 5 signs your AI pilot will never make it to production:

**Different format**:
> The AI initiative death spiral:
>
> Pilot expands → Ownership diffuses → Data bottlenecks → Metrics shift → Vendors take over → Stall
>
> Here's how to break the cycle:
