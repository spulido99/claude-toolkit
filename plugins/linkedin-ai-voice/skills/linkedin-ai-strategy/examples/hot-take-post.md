# Example: Hot Take/Opinion Post

## The Post

---

Unpopular opinion: Most AI strategies fail before the first model is built.

Not because of bad technology.
Because of bad questions.

"How do we use AI?" is the wrong starting point.

Better questions:
- What decisions are we making poorly?
- Where do humans spend time on repetitive judgment calls?
- What would we do if we had perfect predictions?

The companies winning at AI didn't start with AI.

They started with problems worth solving.

Then asked: "Could AI help here?"

Your AI strategy should fit on a sticky note:
"Use AI to [solve specific problem] for [specific user] by [specific date]."

If it takes 40 slides to explain your AI strategy, you don't have one.

Agree or disagree?

## Post Analysis

### Structure Breakdown

| Element | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hook | "Unpopular opinion: Most AI strategies fail before..." | Contrarian, challenges conventional wisdom |
| Clarification | "Not because of bad technology" | Subverts expectation |
| Core insight | "Bad questions" | Simple, memorable diagnosis |
| Wrong vs. right | Bad question vs. better questions | Shows the gap clearly |
| Evidence | "Companies winning at AI..." | Social proof without naming names |
| Prescription | Sticky note format | Memorable, actionable framework |
| Punchy close | "40 slides" line | Quotable, shareable |
| CTA | "Agree or disagree?" | Low-friction engagement |

### Why It Works

1. **"Unpopular opinion" frame**: Signals contrarian thinking, invites debate
2. **Simple diagnosis**: "Bad questions" is easy to remember and repeat
3. **Concrete alternative**: The 3 "better questions" are immediately usable
4. **Sticky note framework**: Visual, memorable, forces simplicity
5. **Punchy closing**: "40 slides" line is quotable and tweetable
6. **Binary CTA**: Easy to engage (just type "agree" or "disagree")

### Metrics This Post Would Target

- **Comments**: Very high (polarizing opinions drive debate)
- **Impressions**: High (controversy increases reach)
- **Shares**: Medium (people share to signal their own views)

### Risks of Hot Takes

1. **Alienating readers**: Some will strongly disagree
2. **Oversimplification**: Complex topics require nuance
3. **Repetitive**: Too many hot takes feel performative

**Mitigation**: Balance with story posts and actionable content

### Variations

**Softer approach**:
> Here's a thought that might be controversial:
> Most AI strategies fail before the first model is built.

**More aggressive**:
> Your AI strategy is probably worthless.
> Here's why.

**Question format**:
> Why do AI strategies fail?
>
> It's not the technology.
> It's not the talent.
> It's not the budget.
>
> It's the questions you're starting with.
